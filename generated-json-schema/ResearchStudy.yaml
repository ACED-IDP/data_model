description: 'Investigation to increase healthcare-related patient-independent knowledge.

  A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a

  series of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related

  knowledge.  This includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative

  effectiveness and other information about medications, devices, therapies

  and other interventional and investigative techniques.  A ResearchStudy

  involves the gathering of information about human or animal subjects.'
