# run 10 processes at a lower priority (10) via nice
# The term niceness itself originates from the idea that a process with a higher niceness value is nicer to other processes in the system and to users by virtue of demanding less CPU powerâ€”freeing up processing time and power for the more demanding programs, who would in this case be less nice to the system from a CPU usage perspective.[1]
